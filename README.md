## History

Originally, the project was nothing more than a copied project, which I had worked on a bit when I was a newbie to programming. That's what the releases **[v0.0.1](https://github.com/shortyapp/shorty/releases/tag/0.0.1)**, **[v0.0.2](https://github.com/shortyapp/shorty/releases/tag/0.0.2)**, and **[v0.0.3](https://github.com/shortyapp/shorty/releases/tag/0.0.3)** especially highlight. Then one evening I borrowed the files from a bunch of crap and thought, why not improve it? That's when Shorty was born.
